Nearly two years ago, I turned 30 and, like I assume most people do when they reach that age, I said to myself "Oh crap, I'm an actual adult." Although I had spent my last ten years working in IT as a computer technician, I never made any attempts to further myself in the industry and was just going through the motions of my daily job. However, with the new realization that I am in fact getting older, I decided it was time to start making sure had a job at a place with good benefits and set myself up for an eventual retirement.

Trying to land a better job meant that I would need to go back to school, because despite having a ton of experience and industry certifications, many HR departments (especially government HRs) shun any résumé that doesn't have a completed degree. So, back to school I went. I completed my Associate of Arts at local community college at a break-neck pace, finishing it in less than a year with an insane work load. I was then accepted into a university as an online student to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 

Once my classes at the university started, I stalled. Unlike my community college courses that were just general education classes, all my classes at the university pertained to IT. My first class involved getting another IT certification and I couldn't bring myself to study for it because, the truth was, I didn't really want another certification. More so, I didn't even want to continue in my current IT path at all. While my younger self was lured into the industry by the thought of working on the leading edge of technology, my career in IT was far from that. Instead, I spent most of my days resetting passwords and trying to squeeze another month out of a machine that should have been retired ten years ago.  

After struggling through nearly six months of the courses and thinking about my future, it became clear that I wasn't going to waste my time getting a degree for a job that I didn't want to be in. Thus, I decided to look for something new. Upon thinking of jobs I would like to do, software engineering and web development immediately came to mind. Coding was something that I have always loved to do. In fact, I built my first webpage with Microsoft Notepad when I was 12. Throughout my career in IT, I would make websites as personal side-projects and would often work on them for hours without realizing how long I had sat there. I became proficient in HTML/CSS and could work my way through some simple Javascript code, but was far from being able to just jump into a coding career.

Investigating what it would take to move into a career in software engineer, I learned about these things called bootcamps. I then found that most offered a sample or prep course to get an idea on what its like to attend the bootcamp. I started the bootcamp prep course at the Flatiron School and was immediately hooked. Just as I have done building websites in the past, I would lose track of time and work on the class until the wee hours of the morning. Something about the combination of building things and puzzle-like problem solving is so completely satisfying to me. 

After working my way through the beginning of the prep course I submitted my application to Flatiron and, a little more than a month later, I have officially started class this week. I could not be happier with my move to software engineering and the fact that the thought of a career in coding motivates an introvert like me enough to happily jump onto a video conference with 20+ strangers, lets me know that it was the right decision as well.
